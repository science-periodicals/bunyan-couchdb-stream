Note: this module is auto published to npm on CircleCI. Only run `npm version
patch|minor|major` and let CI do the rest.

A writable stream that writes log JSON objects (as generated by bunyan) to CouchDB / PouchDB

```js
var bunyan = require('bunyan');
var LogStream = require('bunyan-couchdb-stream');

var log = bunyan.createLogger({
  name: 'test',
  streams: [{
    stream: new LogStream('http://127.0.0.1:5895/mydb'),
    type: 'raw' // this is required
  }],
});

log.info({foo: 'bar'}, 'hello world');
```

If the database does not exists, `bunyan-couchdb-stream` will try to create it.
